# IcyWind
Something new, MAF instances within an MAF instance. What will happen, lets find out if I can do it or if I will just use MEF 
inside of an MAF instance. The purpose of this project is to prevent crashes.

## Features

### Always Update
IcyWind will update League of Legends and the IcyWind Client itself (Why MAF is used instead of MEF). Just keep
IcyWind running at all times

# Warning
If a user tells you to add a file into the "core" folder, do not add any file into this folder. 
The core folder is an extremly critical folder that will give any plugins unrestricted access to the system. 
All plugins should go into the #todo# folder which will allow you to restrict the functions that each plugin gets

# Building the project
Right Click the solution and click rebuild the solution. 
This project uses MAF so just building IcyWind will result in an error. 
Do not modify any of the files in the AddIn folder, unless you know how to use MAF (and won't screw it up for youself).
